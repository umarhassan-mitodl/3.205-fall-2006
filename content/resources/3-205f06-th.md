  caption: Randomly dispersed foreign particles produce "dizzy dendrites," in which
    the tree-like branches in the crystals tend to curve and split, instead of forming
    the straight, symmetric patterns typical of pure crystals. This sample was grown
    in an 80 nanometer-thick film of two blended polymers with randomly dispersed
    clay particles. (Photo courtesy of the [National Institute of Standards and Technology
