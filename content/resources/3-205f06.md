description: Randomly dispersed foreign particles produce "dizzy dendrites," in which
  the tree-like branches in the crystals tend to curve and split, instead of forming
  the straight, symmetric patterns typical of pure crystals. This sample was grown
  in an 80 nanometer-thick film of two blended polymers with randomly dispersed clay
  particles. (Photo courtesy of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
