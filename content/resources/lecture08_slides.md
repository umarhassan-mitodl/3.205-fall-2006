description: 'This file is a resource which contains information on diffusional growth,
  the "moving boundary" problem, growth phenomena: interface control vs. diffusion
  control, diffusion-controlled growth, including melting of a pure material, interdiffusion
  with a moving boundary, and alloy solidification.'
